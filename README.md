===============

kernel 3.4 for sunxi platforms
Support A31/A31s, A23, A33 and A80 platforms.
This has been taken from https://github.com/allwinner-zh/linux-3.4-sunxi.
It looks like Allwinner have backported the Big Little etc functionality for the A80 from 
the v3.14 kernel. My plans is to slowly port this to the master track. Currently this track
builds but I've not tested it on any hardware.
